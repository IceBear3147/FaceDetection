# Dynamic Face Detection Model

## Overview

This repository contains a fork of an existing face detection model that has been enhanced to be more dynamic, automatic, and user-friendly. The improvements focus on optimizing the face detection process, allowing for more flexibility and convenience for developers and users alike.

### Key Features

- **Automatic Face Detection**: The model can automatically detect faces without requiring manual configuration.
- **Dynamic Model Adaptation**: The model adjusts its parameters based on the environment, improving detection accuracy across various conditions.
- **Improved Performance**: Optimized for faster processing with minimal resource usage.
- **Simple Integration**: Easily integrable with existing applications or projects.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow (or other dependencies, depending on the base model used)
- OpenCV (for image processing)
- NumPy (for matrix operations)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/IceBear3147/FaceDetection
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd FaceDetection
    ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. (Optional) If you plan to use GPU acceleration, install the required GPU-specific dependencies (CUDA, cuDNN).
